  "Tomato Late Blight": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Late blight is a plant disease that affects a variety of Solanum spp., including eggplant, pepper, nightshade weeds, and petunia. However, it is most infamously known for its destruction of potato, S. tuberosum, and tomato, S. lycopersicum.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of late blight may be found on any above-ground part of the tomato plant. Infected leaves typically have green to brown patches of dead tissue surrounded by a pale green or gray border.When the weather is very humid and wet, late blight infections can appear water-soaked or dark brown in color, and are often described as appearing greasy. White, fuzzy growth may be found on the undersides of leaves or on lower stems. Stem and petiole lesions are brown and are typically not well defined in shape. Discoloration may also occur on the flowers, causing them to drop. Symptomatic tomato fruits appear mottled, often with golden to dark brown, firm, sunken surfaces. White, fuzzy pathogen growth can also be found in association with the fruit lesions.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The production of pathogen spores is promoted by moist conditions (90-100% relative humidity) with moderate temperatures (60-80°F). Sporangia may germinate at 64-75°F, and zoospores are released at 46-64°F. Mycelia prefer temperatures around 73°F for optimal growth.In cooler wet weather, however, sporangia produce motile zoospores that can infect host tissues. After just 4-5 days of sufficient moisture and moderate temperatures, a new phase of sporulation can occur at the site of the initial infection. New sporangia are then carried by wind and splashed water to new plant tissue, creating new infections. And the disease spreads. Continued and rapid repetition of this asexual disease cycle causes large-scale and fast-advancing late blight epidemics.",
    "organic_solutions": "You can also try spraying your plant with compost water. What this is is really good compost that is in non-chlorinated water. (Just leave your water out for at least 24 hours to remove the chlorine.) The compost will have good microbes in it to help fight the blight naturally.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "Spraying fungicides is the most effective way to prevent late blight. For conventional gardeners and commercial producers, protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil (e.g., Bravo, Echo, Equus, or Daconil) and Mancozeb (Manzate) can be used. Fixed copper products (Kocide) can be used by organic gardeners to prevent late blight infection.",

  "Tomato Target Spot": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Target spot of tomato is caused by the fungal pathogen Corynespora cassiicola.1 The disease occurs on field-grown tomatoes in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Target spot was first observed on tomatoes in the U.S. in Immokalee, Florida in 1967. The disease distribution in the U.S. is limited to the southeastern region, most predominantly in the southern parts of Florida.2,3,4 However, the disease also occurs on tomatoes grown in greenhouse and high tunnel production systems in other areas of North America.5\n\nTarget spot infections reduce yield indirectly by reducing the photosynthetic area and directly by reducing the fruit’s marketability through fruit spots. One study documented a 30% reduction in marketable yield and a 43% reduction in extra-large fruit when comparing production from treated and untreated plants. In some untreated plots, two-thirds of the fruit were discarded because of fruit blemishes. The pathogen C. cassiicola has a wide host range, infecting more than 500 species of plants, including cucumber, cotton, soybean, papaya, and several ornamental and weed hosts.",
    "symptoms": "The target spot fungus can infect all above-ground parts of the tomato plant. Plants are most susceptible as seedlings and just before and during fruiting. The initial foliar symptoms are pinpoint-sized, water-soaked spots on the upper leaf surface. The spots develop into small, necrotic lesions that have light brown centers and dark margins. These symptoms may be confused with symptoms of bacterial spot. The lesions increase in size, become circular with gray to pale brown centers. As the lesions enlarge, they can develop darker concentric circles, hence, the name target spot. The concentric circles are similar to those seen on early blight lesions. Yellow halos can form around the lesions on some varieties. Lesions can coalesce, forming large blighted areas on the leaflets, and infected leaves may drop prematurely.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The target spot pathogen survives between crops on plant debris and alternate host plants, including weed hosts. The fungus produces spores, which are spread by wind and wind-blown and splashing rain. Infection of tomato plants requires high humidity levels, periods of leaf wetness from 16 to 44 hours and temperatures between 60° and 90°F. Optimal disease development occurs at temperatures between 68° and 82°F. Target spot tends to be more severe on plants with lush canopies that dry more slowly. Fruit wounded by hail or blowing sand are predisposed to infection.",
    "organic_solutions": "Cultural practices for target spot management include improving airflow through the canopy by wider plant spacing and avoiding over-fertilizing with nitrogen, which can cause overly lush canopy formation. Pruning suckers and older leaves in the lower canopy can also increase airflow and reduce leaf wetness.Avoid planting tomatoes near old plantings. Inspect seedlings for target spot symptoms before transplanting. Manage weeds, which may serve as alternate hosts, and avoid the use of overhead irrigation. Destroy crop residues shortly after the final harvest, and rotate away from tomato and other known hosts for at least three years. Resistance to target spot is not available in commercial tomato varieties, although partial resistance has been observed in wild species of tomato.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "The primary strategy used to manage target spot on tomato is the regular application of fungicides. Applications should begin before symptoms appear when conditions are favorable for infection and disease development. Fungicides may need to be applied at regular intervals (every 10 to 14 days is common) depending on the label directions of the products used. Full coverage of all plant surfaces is needed for the best control of target spot.\n\nMany fungicides are registered to control of target spot on tomatoes. Growers should consult regional disease management guides for recommended products.10 Products containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and copper oxychloride have been shown to provide good control of target spot in research trials. The strobilurin fungicides azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, the fungicide boscalid, and the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) elicitor acibenzolar-S-methyl have also been shown to provide good control of target spot.\n\nThe labels of many of the fungicides registered for target spot control indicate that the products should be tank-mixed or alternated with fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the target spot pathogen",

The causative agents are motile bacteria, Liberibacter spp. The disease is vectored and transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, and the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae, also known as the two-spotted citrus psyllid. It has also been shown to be graft-transmissible.",
    "symptoms": "HLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant. Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The causative agents are fastidious phloem-restricted, Gram-negative bacteria in the gracilicutes clade. The Asian form, Ca. L. asiaticus is heat tolerant. This means the greening symptoms can develop at temperatures up to 35 °C. The African form, Ca. L. africanus, and American form, Ca. L. americanus, are heat sensitive, thus symptoms only develop when the temperature is in the range 20–25 °C. Although T. erytreae is the natural vector of African citrus greening and D. citri is the natural vector of American and Asian citrus greening, either psyllid can in fact transmit either of the greening agents under experimental conditions.",

The species of powdery mildew that affects squash foliage (Erysiphe cichoracearum) is different from those that target peas (Erysiphe pisi) or eggplants (Leveillula taurica).",
    "symptoms": "t is one of the most common plant diseases, and because its appearance is so distinct, it’s fairly easy to identify. Powdery mildew  makes the leaves look like they’ve been dusted with talcum powder. The mildew is white to gray. Most of that white dust consists of spores which are easily carried by wind to other nearby leaves.",
    "cycle_lethality": "Powdery mildew is largely an aesthetic issue (meaning it makes the plants look not-so-good). However, a heavy layer of powdery mildew on squash leaves does affect their ability to photosynthesize and can, over time, affect the plant’s productivity and reduce yields. When severe, it will cause leaves to shrivel and die. These dead leaves can develop rot that can quickly spread to the crown of the plant.Powdery mildew on squash also can affect the plants resistance to other pests and diseases. When weakened by the disease, squash plants are more prone to issues with squash bugs, vine borers, botrytis, and other pests and diseases.",

In severe cases, plants may die as it is extremely difficult to find a cure once the disease takes hold. However, there are several options for growers to prevent it from occurring and spreading.",
    "symptoms": "On some cultivars, leaves may display several small lesions – 1/4 to 1/2 centimeter – covering over 80% of the leaf’s area, whereas on others, fewer large lesions – larger than 1/2 centimeter – may be visible.Disease symptoms can appear throughout the above-ground portion of the plant, which may include leaf spot, fruit spot and stem canker. However, early symptoms show up as water-soaked lesions on leaves that can quickly change from green to dark brown and enlarge into spots that are up to 1/4 inch in diameter with slightly raised margins.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The pathogen survives in and on seeds and in plant debris (McGrath & Boucher, 2012). Although persistence of debris and the pathogen depend on environmental conditions, it is very common for the pathogen to survive in debris for at least a year. However, once infected debris gets decomposed and the organism is exposed to soil, it cannot stay alive for more than a few weeks.Disease development is favored by relative humidity above 85%, extended periods of leaf wetness and heat waves, especially when night temperatures remain above 70°F. Short periods (three days or more) below 40% relative humidity will reduce disease severity and delay development.",
    "organic_solutions": "Beneficial microorganisms containing products, such as Serenade and Sonata, can reduce pepper leaf spot if used proactively. However, once the disease has spread to more than 5% of plants, these products can’t suppress the disease.",

The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips and younger leaves may be twisted. The fruit may be distorted, yellow blotches and necrotic spots may occur on both ripe and green fruit and there may be internal browning of the fruit wall. In young plants, the infection reduces the set of fruit and may cause distortions and blemishes. The entire plant may be dwarfed and the flowers discoloured.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The infection is generally restricted to plants that are grown in seedbeds and transplanted as it is in the handling processes that the virus is likely to gain entry. Symptoms on other plant hosts include blistering, chlorosis, curling, distortion, dwarfing and mottling of the leaves.",

  "Corn Cercospora leaf spot": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Grey leaf spot (GLS) is a foliar fungal disease that affects maize, also known as corn. GLS is considered one of the most significant yield-limiting diseases of corn worldwide. There are two fungal pathogens that cause GLS: Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina. Symptoms seen on corn include leaf lesions, discoloration (chlorosis), and foliar blight. Distinct symptoms of GLS are rectangular, brown to gray necrotic lesions that run parallel to the leaf, spanning the spaces between the secondary leaf veins. The fungus survives in the debris of topsoil and infects healthy crops via asexual spores called conidia. Environmental conditions that best suit infection and growth include moist, humid, and warm climates. Poor airflow, low sunlight, overcrowding, improper soil nutrient and irrigation management, and poor soil drainage can all contribute to the propagation of the disease. Management techniques include crop resistance, crop rotation, residue management, use of fungicides, and weed control. The purpose of disease management is to prevent the amount of secondary disease cycles as well as to protect leaf area from damage prior to grain formation. Corn grey leaf spot is an important disease of corn production in the United States, economically significant throughout the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. However, it is also prevalent in Africa, Central America, China, Europe, India, Mexico, the Philippines, northern South America, and Southeast Asia. The teleomorph (sexual phase) of Cercospora zeae-maydis is assumed to be Mycosphaerella.",
    "symptoms": "Major outbreaks of grey leaf spot occur whenever favorable weather conditions are present. The initial symptoms of grey leaf spot emerge as small, dark, moist spots that are encircled by a thin, yellow radiance (lesions formation). The tissue within the “spot\" begins to die as spot size increases into longer, narrower leaf lesions. Although initially brownish and yellow, the characteristic grey color that follows is due to the production of grey fungal spores (conidia) on the lesion surface. These symptoms that are similar in shape, size and discoloration are also prevalent on the corn husks and leaf sheaths. Leaf sheath lesions are not surrounded by a yellow radiance, but rather a brown or dark purple radiance. This dark brown or purple discoloration on leaf sheaths is also characteristic to northern corn leaf blight (Exserohilum turcicum), southern corn leaf blight (Bipolaris maydis), or northern corn leaf spot (Bipolaris zeicola). Corn grey leaf spot mature lesions are easily diagnosed and distinguishable from these other diseases. Mature corn grey leaf spot lesions have a brown, rectangular and vein-limited shape. Secondary and tertiary leaf veins limit the width of the lesion and sometimes individual lesions can combine to blight entire leaves.",
    "cycle_lethality": "Corn grey leaf spot can be an extremely devastating disease as potential yield losses range from 5 to 40 US bushels per acre (440 to 3,480 L/ha). At higher disease levels, even greater losses can result.",
    "organic_solutions": "In order to best prevent and manage corn grey leaf spot, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion. This is done by limiting the amount of secondary disease cycles and protecting leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation. High risks for corn grey leaf spot are divided into eight factors, which require specific management strategies.\n\nHigh risk factors for grey leaf spot in corn:\n\nSusceptible hybrid\nContinuous corn\nLate planting date\nMinimum tillage systems\nField history of severe disease\nEarly disease activity (before tasseling)\nIrrigation\nFavorable weather forecast for disease\n\nInorganic Solution: In most cases, fungicides should be applied at or after tasseling. For example, a fungicide has been shown to be most effective for northern corn leaf blight and GLS when applied prior to tasseling to two weeks after tasseling.3 Fungicide products containing a strobilurin and strobilurin/triazole premix are most effective at preventing yield loss when applied in response to GLS disease presence.2 For example, Delaro® 325 SC fungicide is labeled for Grey leaf spot and can be sprayed at the critical time period where necessary.",

Blotches may coalesce until they nearly cover the leaflet, which then appears purplish to reddish to brown.",
    "symptoms": "Strawberries with leaf scorch may first show signs of issue with the development of small purplish blemishes that occur on the topside of leaves. Over time, the spots will continue to grow larger and darken. In severe cases, dark spots may even cover entire portions of strawberry plant leaves and cause them to completely dry and fall from the plant.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The fungus overwinters on infected leaves. The fungus produces spore forming structures in the spring on both surfaces of dead leaves. These structures produce spores abundantly in midsummer. In the presence of free water, these spores can germinate and infect the plant within 24 hours. Older and middle-aged leaves are infected more easily than young ones.\nThough the foliage of the infected plants is not aesthetically pleasing, it is seldom that the presence of this fungus impacts the quality of the strawberry crop itself.",
    "organic_solutions": "In matted row or perennial strawberry systems, select a planting site with good air drainage and sun exposure. Cultivars resistant to leaf scorch may be available and need to be evaluated for specific horticultural characteristics. Plant new transplants frequently, and allow adequate spacing between them to increase airflow. Control weeds. Avoid amendment with supplemental nitrogen in spring, as this may enhance disease. Keep moisture levels down and avoid long wetness periods by monitoring irrigation schedules; if possible, use drip irrigation rather than overhead. Remove foliage and crop residues after picking or at renovation to remove inoculum and delay disease increase in late summer and fall.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "Several fungicides can be used to remove the fungus that causes leaf blight. Make sure you only apply what is necessary as the application of too much fungicide can result in resistant-leaf-blight fungus, which will no longer be killed by the fungicide. Several recommended fungicides for leaf blight include copper, dodine, folpet and captan. Make sure you spray both above and below the plants as the fungicide can only penetrate through the underside of the leaves. Therefore, only spraying above the plants is ineffective.",

They are often restricted to an individual shoot or to shoots originating from the same spur or cane. Symptomatic leaves can dry completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round, dark spots each bordered by a brown-purple ring, may occur. These fruit spots, which are better viewed on white cultivars, may appear at any time between fruit set and ripening.

    "symptoms": "The first symptoms of early blight appear as small, circular or irregular, dark-brown to black spots on the older (lower) leaves.These spots enlarge up to 3/8 inch in diameter and gradually may become angular-shaped.Multiple lesions on the same leaf also may coalesce, or grow together, to form one mass. As lesions coalesce, chlorosis (yellowing of plant tissue) may be visible due to clusters of infection. Elongated, brown to black lesions also may develop on stems and petioles of infected plants.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The pathogen favors older and senescing leaf tissue, as well as plants stressed by injury, nutrient deficiency, and insect feeding. The rate of infection in the early season is generally low but increases after flowering and is most rapid during tuber bulking later in the season.Tuber infection is most common in potato cultivars that are highly susceptible to skinning, such as red- and white-skinned cultivars. Secondary spread of infection does not occur on stored potato tubers and, unlike late blight tuber lesions, early blight tuber lesions usually do not serve as infection courts for other decay organisms.",
    "organic_solutions": "As soon as you spot blight, you may be able to save your crop by cutting the foliage and stems down to ground level immediately. This obviously means that the tubers won't get any larger, but it should prevent the fungus travelling down to them. Leave the tubers in the soil undisturbed for three weeks. This should kill off any lingering spores, preventing them from infecting the crop when it is lifted, and will also allow the skins of the potatoes to harden. The potatoes will be edible but use them up as soon as possible – tubers from blighted plants do not store well. Discard any that show any signs of blight.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "Since most commercially acceptable potato cultivars are susceptible to early blight, the application of foliar fungicides is the primary management tactic. Mancozeb and chlorothalonil are perhaps the most frequently used protectant fungicides for early blight management but provide insufficient control under high disease pressure. Therefore, the application of locally systemic and translaminar fungicides often is necessary for control at high levels of disease pressure, especially under irrigation.",

  "Grape Black Rot": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Grape black rot is a fungal disease caused by an ascomycetous fungus, Guignardia bidwellii, that attacks grape vines during hot and humid weather. “Grape black rot originated in eastern North America, but now occurs in portions of Europe, South America, and Asia. It can cause complete crop loss in warm, humid climates, but is virtually unknown in regions with arid summers.” The name comes from the black fringe that borders growing brown patches on the leaves. The disease also attacks other parts of the plant, “all green parts of the vine: the shoots, leaf and fruit stems, tendrils, and fruit. The most damaging effect is to the fruit”.\n\nGrape black rot affects many grape growers throughout the United States, therefore, it is important to understand the disease life cycle and environmental conditions to best manage the disease. Once infection takes place, different methods are available to control the disease.",
    "symptoms": "Relatively small, brown circular lesions develop on infected leaves and within a few days tiny black spherical fruiting bodies (pycnidia) protrude from them. Elongated black lesions on the petiole may eventually girdle these organs, causing the affected leaves to wilt. Shoot infection results in large black elliptical lesions. These lesions may contribute to breakage of shoots by wind, or in severe cases, may girdle and kill young shoots altogether. This fungus bides its time. Most plants show very little signs of infection until its too late. They will look very healthy until fruit sets. Even flowering will be normal.\n\nInfection of the fruit is the most serious phase of the disease and may result in substantial economic loss. Infected berries first appear light or chocolate brown; it will have a spot that looks very round, like the eye of a bird. That spot will get larger and infect more of the fruit bunch and more of the plant. This creates masses of black pycnidia developing on the surface. Finally, infected berries shrivel and turn into hard black raisin-like bodies that are called mummies.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The disease cycle begins with the overwintering structures. The grape black rot pathogen overwinters in many parts of the grape vine, especially mummies and lesions, and is able to overwinter on the vineyard floor. In fact, \"Viable lesions capable of producing conidia can persist in wood for at least 2 years.\" Spring rains release the ascospores and conidia contained in the overwintering structures and these spores are “spread by wind and rain‐splash to infect leaves, blossoms and young fruit”. Some of the mummies on the ground can have a significant discharge of ascospores that begins about two to three weeks after bud breaks and will mature one to two weeks after the start of bloom. In the presence of moisture, these ascospores germinate slowly, taking 36 to 48 hours, but eventually penetrate the young leaves and fruit stems (pedicels). The infections become visible after 8 to 25 days.",
    "organic_solutions": "ultural control consists of the management of the fields and sanitation methods to optimally grow grape crops.\n\nMany universities and professors suggest the following cultural control practices:\n\nThe first cultural control method is to choose the right grape cultivar for the region that the grape will be grown in. Grape cultivars differ in their susceptibility to diseases, including differences in the disease black rot. Some varieties are less susceptible, while others are more prone to the disease when the right environmental conditions occur. Through research, many lists of grapes varieties will show the amount of resistance a variety has to disease and how the variety should be grown. A list of grape varieties is a good place to start for selecting the right grape variety.\n\nProper grape management in the field is important to control black rot disease. The placement of the grape plants is important to provide for proper aeration and lighting. “Choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation.” Proper training of grape vines should be practiced. Many people use trellising to keep the vines off the ground. Trellising is a form of plant training, which is the arrangement of plant parts spatially to optimize productivity. Having the grape vines off the ground “reduces the time that vines remain wet from dew and rain and thus limits the amount of infection”. As the current seasons growth occurs, tie the new growth in a spatial manner to allow for air circulation and sunlight to affect the whole grape plant.\n\nA proper pruning technique is another cultural control method to limit diseases. Prune each vine every year during the dormant period. This dormant pruning is heavily researched to provide the term-balanced pruning. This is done by using the weight of the previous year’s cane growth (1- yr-old canes) to determine how many buds should be retained for the current production year. Up to four pounds of pruning can occur during the season. Remove excess growth, diseased and overwintering berries, leaves, and tendrils from the vineyard, and burn or otherwise destroy them.     This practice reduces inoculum of the fungus, thus limiting disease. During the season, minor pruning to train the canopy growth may occur to help with aeration.\n\nInorganic Methods: The use of chemical control is widely available for agricultural purposes. To apply chemical applications, look at the fungicide label for proper use. Be sure that the conditions are optimal to spray to avoid drift and inefficiencies of the fungicide due to application. Fungicide guidelines must be followed. There are a wide variety of chemicals that are available for both regular and organic growers.\n\nCommercially, application of fungicides may be costly. To cut down on costs, one must understand the life cycle of the pathogens. Different fungicides are more effective at certain infection stages. Understand that throughout the development of the plant, different fungicides should be considered to protect plant health. In order to cut down on spraying costs, it is important to understand life cycle of the pathogen. “Research in New York demonstrated berries of most varieties become resistant to black rot infection 3-4 weeks after bloom, therefore, sprays for black rot should not be needed at this time”. Understanding times to limit application is important for good production practices. This shows that preventative chemical measures before the three to four weeks would be optimal. Each region should develop their own fungicide application program in correlation with cultural practices.\n\nThe most common fungicides that prove to be excellent for certain regions of the United States for controlling black rot are Sovran 50WG, Flint 50WG, Abound Flowable (2.08F), and Pristine 38WDG. Some of these fungicides may only be available for commercial use, however homeowners may go to a hardware store or fungicide distributor for similar fungicides.",

  "Cherry Powdery mildew": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Powdery mildew of sweet and sour cherry is caused by Podosphaera clandestina, an obligate biotrophic fungus. Mid- and late-season sweet cherry (Prunus avium) cultivars are commonly affected, rendering them unmarketable due to the covering of white fungal growth on the cherry surface. Season long disease control of both leaves and fruit is critical to minimize overall disease pressure in the orchard and consequently to protect developing fruit from accumulating spores on their surfaces.",
    "symptoms": "Initial symptoms, often occurring 7 to 10 days after the onset of the first irrigation, are light roughly-circular, powdery looking patches on young, susceptible leaves (newly unfolded, and light green expanding leaves). Older leaves develop an age-related (ontogenic) resistance to powdery mildew and are naturally more resistant to infection than younger leaves. Look for early leaf infections on root suckers, the interior of the canopy or the crotch of the tree where humidity is high. In contrast to other fungi, powdery mildews do not need free water to germinate but germination and fungal growth are favored by high humidity. The disease is more likely to initiate on the undersides (abaxial) of leaves but will occur on both sides at later stages.",
    "cycle_lethality": "The fungus overwinters in buds on twigs and as chasmothecia, which are spore-containing structures, on the bark of twigs and branches. Secondary spores produced in spring spread the fungus to new growth. Infections can be severe in commercial orchards during years of low rainfall, high humidity, and warm temperatures (70° to 80°F). The disease is particularly severe on new growth, such as shoots of inner scaffolds, and can infect fruit as well, causing direct crop loss. In warm, humid, coastal areas, powdery mildew can also be severe after harvest.",
    "organic_solutions": "Manage irrigation. In the arid west in a typical dry spring, early irrigation may stimulate early cherry powdery mildew infections. Recent research has shown that a two-week delay in irrigation delayed disease initiation two weeks with no negative impact on fruit.\nPruning. Humid conditions favor cherry powdery mildew. A well pruned canopy will promote more air flow and leaf drying, reducing these humid conditions favorable for disease. Pruning will also help to achieve good spray coverage.\nRoot sucker management. Root suckers are preferred by powdery mildews since they are highly susceptible leaf tissue. Root suckers are close to the irrigation and high humidity levels favor the onset and spread of infections. Additionally, sprays aimed at the canopy often do not protect root suckers allowing fungal inocula to survive all season. Remove root suckers to eliminate this source for infection of the canopy and fruit.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "The key to managing powdery mildew on the fruit is to keep the disease off of the leaves. Most synthetic fungicides are preventative, not eradicative, so be pro-active about disease prevention. Maintain a consistent program from shuck fall through harvest. Consider post-harvest preventative measures (e.g. application of sulfur, prevent trees from pushing for leaf growth) to obstruct the fungus from overwintering. Preharvest fungicide applications should be based on the residual period of the product. Rotate between modes of action (MOA) in order to avoid resistance.",

  "Corn Common rust": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Common rust frequently occurs in the northern U.S. in mid to later summer. It rarely reaches levels that cause yield loss in commercial hybrids. It is most problematic during prolonged periods of cool, wet weather. Rust diseases are generally easy to identify by the appearance of brown pustules. The common rust fungus overwinters in the southern U.S. and Mexico. Urediniospores are blown north to the Midwestern Corn Belt in the summer and infection occurs in June or July. Young leaves are most susceptible to infection and pustules are more likely to form after corn silking. The disease favors cool temperatures (60 - 76 degrees F), heavy dews, about six hours of leaf wetness, and relative humidity greater than 95 percent. Temperatures above 80 degrees F suppress disease development and spread.",
    "symptoms": "Common rust produces rust-colored to dark brown, elongated pustules on both leaf surfaces. The pustules contain rust spores (urediniospores) that are cinnamon brown in color. Pustules darken as they age. Leaves, as well as sheaths, can be infected. Under severe conditions leaf chlorosis and death may occur. Common rust can be differentiated from Southern rust by the brown pustules occurring on both top and bottom leaf surfaces with common rust.",
    "cycle_lethality": "Unlike most other foliar diseases of corn, this rust fungus does not overwinter in crop residue. Spores must be blown northward during the growing season (from mid-June to mid-July) from subtropical and tropical regions where this fungus survives on corn or wood sorrel, the alternate host. Young leaves are generally more susceptible to infection than older leaves. Rust development and spread are favored by prolonged periods of cool temperatures ranging from 60° to 74°F and high relative humidity. Under these conditions, pustules develop on susceptible corn hybrids and sweet corn varieties within 7 days after infection.",
    "organic_solutions": "Common rust usually appears to some degree in the southern United States and the Corn Belt every year. If infection occurs late in the season, the potential for economic yield loss is fairly low. However, if infection occurs at early vegetative growth stages and conditions are favorable for disease development, the potential for economic yield loss increases.\n\nBecause corn products differ in their level of tolerance to common rust, the rate of disease development may be different for each product that is grown. Late-planted corn is more likely to have higher levels of infection since it will likely have young, more susceptible leaves during the time when spores first arrive from overwintering locations.\n\nThe best management option is growing corn products with higher levels of tolerance to common rust. General plant tolerance reduces the number and size of pustules and the overall severity of infection.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "Fungicides can effectively control common rust if initial applications are made while there are only a few pustules present per leaf. Use of fungicides is fairly common in sweet corn and seed corn production, but is rarely warranted in field corn because common rust rarely causes economically damaging yield loss in field corn. Scouting each corn field on a regular schedule will help determine if fungicide applications should be considered. If significant levels of common rust are present on the lower leaves prior to silking and cool, humid, or wet weather is likely to occur a fungicide application may be beneficial.",

    "cycle_lethality": "The first symptoms appear as small, water-soaked, circular spots 1/16 to 1/8\" in diameter on the undersides of older leaves. The centers of these spots then turn gray to tan and have a dark-brown margin. The spots are distinctively circular and are often quite numerous. As the spots age, they sometimes enlarge and often coalesce. A diagnostic feature of this disease is the presence of many dark-brown, pimple-like structures called pycnidia (fruiting bodies of the fungus) that are readily visible in the tan centers of the spots. When spots are numerous, affected leaves turn yellow and eventually shrivel up, brown, and drop off. Defoliation usually starts on the oldest leaves and can quickly spread progressively up the plant toward the new growth. Significant losses can result from early leaf-drop and often leads to the subsequent sunscalding of the fruit when plants are prematurely defoliated.",
    "organic_solutions": "It is very important to eliminate initial sources of inoculum by removing or destroying as much of the tomato debris as possible after harvest in the fall. Alternatively, in large fields where plant removal is not practical, plant debris can be covered and buried by deep plowing.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "The fungicides chlorothalonil and mancozeb are labeled for homeowner use. Since these are protectant materials, they should be applied as soon as symptoms are observed and repeated as necessary when conditions are favorable for disease development and spread.",

  "Apple Black Rot": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Black rot is an important disease of apple caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. Black rot fungus infects a wide variety of hardwood trees, including apple and pear. Infected trees are often a source of infection for nearby younger bearing blocks.",
    "symptoms": "The black rot pathogen infects limbs, trunks, leaves and fruit resulting in reduced productivity and quality of yield. \nLeaf infections result in a disease called frog-eye leaf spot. On leaves, the disease first appears as a tiny purple fleck which eventually enlarges into a circular lesion about 4-5 mm in diameter.",
    "cycle_lethality": "Severely infected leaves eventually turn yellow and drop, resulting in premature senescence of affected trees and predisposing them to winter injury. Defoliation year after year stresses trees and greatly reduces vigour. Damage to limbs caused by cankers from other disease - or wounds caused by insects, pruning and hail or winter injury - provide an entrance for the fungus to invade and become established. Fire blight cankers are often colonized by black rot fungus. Limb cankers first appear as reddish or pinkish, brown sunken areas in the bark (Figure 4-146). Cankers often remain small and superficial but sometimes enlarge up to 50 cm in length along the infected limb, killing and cracking the bark",
    "organic_solutions": "Pruning out diseased limbs and dead wood is an important practice to reduce the inoculum sources within the orchard. It is important to remove prunings from the orchard or burn them since black rot fungus can survive on dead tissue. Alternatively, chopping up the prunings on the orchard floor with a flail mower reduces inoculum levels. Woodpiles must not be stacked in or near orchards since they can be a major source of inoculum. Make an attempt to scout surrounding woodlots and identify hardwood trees infected with the disease. If possible, remove and burn these trees to decrease potential disease pressure. It is important to obtain a neighbour's permission to cut down infected trees identified on an adjacent property.",

  "Peach Bacterial spot": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Bacterial spot is an important disease of peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums caused by Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (XAP), formerly Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni. The disease’s symptoms include fruit spots, leaf spots and twig cankers.",
    "symptoms": "Fruit symptoms include pitting, cracking, gumming and watersoaked tissue. Fruit infected by bacterial spot are more susceptible to other fruit diseases such as brown rot and rhizopus, as well as infestations by insects. Severe leaf spot infections can cause early defoliation. Severe defoliation can result in reduced fruit size, and sunburn and cracking of fruit. Early defoliated trees can be less vigorous and more prone to winter damage.",
    "cycle_lethality": "Bacterial spot multiplication in leaves is favored by wet conditions that cause water congestion in plant tissue (Zehr et al). Rains, dew and high relative humidity assist bacterial entry into plants and multiplication. Spread and entry of the bacterial spot pathogen into plants is favored by abrasions and nicks caused by blowing sand, especially on outside peach rows adjacent to field roads. High wind speeds from sprayers may also help to spread bacterial spot.",
    "organic_solutions": "Plant susceptible varieties on the inside of orchard blocks with the most resistant varieties on the exposed orchard edge. Protect trees from strong winds by establishing shelter belt trees on the windward side of the orchard. Another strategy is to establish sod strips between trees and to use gravel or other dust-suppressing methods on nearby dirt roads. Removal of gummy-blackened branch tips typical of bacterial spot during spring pruning may help somewhat to reduce inoculum levels.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "Bactericides are available for suppression of bacterial spot. Initial treatments focus on suppression of leaf infection and later on protection of fruit as they emerge from the shuck. Bactericide treatment may not be sufficient to eliminate symptoms under conditions very favorable for disease development.",

  "Apple Scab": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Apple scab is a common disease of plants in the rose family (Rosaceae) that is caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis. While this disease affects several plant genera, including Sorbus, Cotoneaster, and Pyrus, it is most commonly associated with the infection of Malus trees, including species of flowering crabapple, as well as cultivated apple.",
    "symptoms": "The first symptoms of this disease are found in the foliage, blossoms, and developing fruits of affected trees, which develop dark, irregularly-shaped lesions upon infection.",
    "cycle_lethality": "Although apple scab rarely kills its host, infection typically leads to fruit deformation and premature leaf and fruit drop, which enhance the susceptibility of the host plant to abiotic stress and secondary infection. The reduction of fruit quality and yield may result in crop losses of up to 70%, posing a significant threat to the profitability of apple producers. To reduce scab-related yield losses, growers often combine preventive practices, including sanitation and resistance breeding, with reactive measures, such as targeted fungicide or biocontrol treatments, to prevent the incidence and spread of apple scab in their crops.",
    "organic_solutions": "Shred fallen leaves in the fall with a mower to help speed up decomposition.\nPrune your apple trees to open up branching and allow more air circulation. When watering your apple trees, avoid getting foliage wet. Apply dolomitic lime in the fall, after leaf drop, to increase pH and to help reduce fungal spores in the spring.",

  "Corn Northern Leaf Blight": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Typical symptoms of northern corn leaf blight are canoe-shaped lesions 1 inch to 6 inches long. The lesions are initially bordered by gray-green margins. They eventually turn tan colored and may contain dark areas of fungal sporulation. The length or size of lesions may vary with in different corn hybrids reactions with different resistance genes. Lesions begin on the lower leaves and then spread to upper leaves. Severe symptoms can progress rapidly, resulting in blighted leaves. The disease can be confused with symptoms of Goss's leaf blight on some hybrids, and perhaps with Stewarts wilt where this disease occurs.",

    "cycle_lethality": "The disease is most prevalent during moderate temperatures (64 to 80 degrees F) with prolonged periods of moisture. It typically appears at or after silking, but the disease is usually more severe when infection occurs earlier.\nThe pathogen is the fungus Exserohilum turcicum (syn. Helminthosporium turcicum). It overwinters on corn leaf debris. Several races of this pathogen are known that interact differently with different resistance genes. NCLB can reduce yield when conditions are favorable\nfor early development of the disease. Lesions reduce the leaf area of the plant that carries out photosynthesis. The more lesions on a plant and the earlier in the season the lesions develop, the greater the loss of photosynthetic area. If lesions have reached the ear leaf or higher during the two weeks before and after tasseling, yield loss could occur. Hybrid corn yield could be reduced as much as 30 percent if lesions are present prior to or at tasseling. Yield losses in popcorn, sweet corn, or other specialty corn production systems may be greater.",
    "organic_solutions": "Because corn products differ in their level of tolerance to common rust, the rate of disease development may be different for each product that is grown. Late-planted corn is more likely to have higher levels of infection since it will likely have young, more susceptible leaves during the time when spores first arrive from overwintering locations.\n\nProduction practices that encourage residue to decompose will reduce the amount of fungus present to infect the next corn crop. Continuous corn and no-till or reduced tillage systems are at high risk for disease development due to the amount of residue left on the soil surface.\n\n\nInorganic Solution: Fungicides are available for in-season management of NCLB. However, it is important to remember that fungicide applications are an additional cost to corn production, and economic factors (including corn market prices, fungicide application costs, and disease factors), must be considered when deciding whether or not to apply a fungicide for NCLB management. Currently, there are no thresholds specifically for NCLB management to aid in fungicide decisions; however, it is important to prevent yield loss by protecting the ear leaf and the leaves above it as the plant enters the reproductive stages.",

  "Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus": {
    "type": "disease",
    "description": "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus is undoubtedly one of the most damaging pathogens of tomato, and it limits production of tomato in many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It is also a problem in many countries that have a Mediterranean climate such as California. Thus, the spread of the virus throughout California must be considered as a serious potential threat to the tomato industry.",
    "symptoms": "Infected tomato plants initially show stunted and erect or upright plant growth; plants infected at an early stage of growth will show severe stunting. However, the most diagnostic symptoms are those in leaves.\nLeaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and interveinal and marginal yellowing. The internodes of infected plants become shortened and, together with the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance, which is sometimes referred to as 'bonsai' or broccoli'-like growth. Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and fall off (abscise). Fruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are infected at an early age, and it is not uncommon for losses of 100% to be experienced in fields with heavily infected plants.",
    "cycle_lethality": "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus is a geminivirus (family Geminiviridae). Although it can infect a relatively wide range of plant species, tomato is the host to which the virus is best adapted and that facilitates the build-up of the virus to high incidences in the field. Other hosts include solanaceous crops, which may develop symptomless infections, and weeds (e.g., nightshade and jimsonweed).\n\nIn addition, the virus causes leaf curl in certain varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the ornamental plant lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum). A range of weeds from other families can be infected by this virus, but most of these do not develop obvious disease symptoms. It is not known how well whiteflies acquire the virus from symptomless hosts. However, it has been hypothesized that these hosts serve as a 'bridge' for the virus in the absence of tomato crops, and that perennial weeds help allow the virus to become permanently established.",
    "organic_solutions": "Plant immediately after any tomato-free period or true winter season.\nAvoid planting new fields near older fields (especially those with TYLCV-infected plants).\nManage WHITEFLIES.\nCover plants with floating row covers of fine mesh (Agryl or Agribon) to protect from whitefly infestations.\nRogue diseased plants when incidence of virus infection is low.\nPractice good weed management in and around fields to the extent feasible.",
    "inorganic_solutions": "Use a neonicotinoid insecticide, such as dinotefuran (Venom) imidacloprid (AdmirePro, Alias, Nuprid, Widow, and others) or thiamethoxam (Platinum), as a soil application or through the drip irrigation system at transplanting of tomatoes or peppers.",
